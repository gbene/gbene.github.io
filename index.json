The first parameter can be expressed in different ways but the main two are:\n Strike Dip direction  The second parameter on the other hand is defined only by one value defined as the Dip angle\nThe strike and dip direction of a plane are strictly linked.\n The strike is defined as the direction given by the intersection line between the given plane and a horizontal plane. The dip direction is the angle orthogonal to the strike.\n As an example a plane with 90° of strike has a dip direction of 180°. To visualize this relationship we can use the right hand rule:\nthe thumb coincides with the direction while the direction of fingers (palm facing downward) the dip direction of the plane.\nThis way with a value of strike = 90° we can extrapolate that the plane has a direction of 90° and it is dipping South (180°).\nThese basic parameters can be very usefull in geology to understand the general orientation of rock strata encountered on the field and so their overall geometry.\nPlotting planes To efficiently analyze the gathered data we can use stereoplots. These kind of plot are obtained as the equatorial projection of the intersection of a plane or line typically with the southern hemisphere of a sphere. In this way planes are rappresented as curves while lines as dots. When we have a high number of planes some patterns can emerge such as planes dipping in the same general direction and with similar inclination angles. This grouping is called a set of planes. On stereoplots defining sets can be very difficult especially if there are lots of sets and planes with different orientation. To semplify the view usually poles are used1.\nmplstereonet  To know more about mplstereonet go to https://mplstereonet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mplstereonet.html   Using the mplstereonet library we can plot geological data as lines or poles by giving the appropriate strike and dip measurements of the given plane. The process to generate random planes is not that complex since the values that need to be generated are only two.\nFirst we need to install the two main libraries: mplstereonet and numpy using pip:\npip install mplstereonet numpy  Now we can start scripting. Let\u0026rsquo;s plot a simple plane with 90° strike and 60° dip angle.\nimport mplstereonet as mpl import matplotlib.pyplot as plt strike = 90 #strike value dip = 60 #dip value fig = plt.figure('Stereoplot') #initialize a figure with the name 'Stereoplot' ax = fig.add_subplot(111,projection='stereonet') #add plot in the figure with the stereonet projection ax.grid() #add a grid ax.plane(strike,dip,'k-') #plot the plane data as a black line ax.pole(strike,dip,'kx') #plot the corresponding pole of the plane as a black x plt.show() #show the plot   Example 1 result  Adding random measurements can be archived using numpy random library\nimport numpy.random as r import mplstereonet as mpl import matplotlib.pyplot as plt strike = r.randint(0,361) #random strike value (range from min to max-1) dip = r.randint(0,91) #random dip value print(f'strike:{strike}, dip dir:{(strike+90)%360}, dip:{dip}') #print string to display the strike, dip dir and dip values. ''' The dip direction can be calculated by adding 90°and applying the reminder operator % to constrain the result to max 360. For example if the strike is 300 the dip direction will be 30° because 390%360 = 30. ''' fig = plt.figure('Stereoplot') #initialize a figure with the name 'Stereoplot' ax = fig.add_subplot(111,projection='stereonet') #add plot in the figure with the stereonet projection ax.grid() #add a grid ax.plane(strike,dip,'k-') #plot the plane data as a black line ax.pole(strike,dip,'kx') #plot the corresponding pole of the plane as a black x plt.show() #show the plot  The plot will be similar to the figure of the first examlpe but with a random value of strike and dip angle.\nIf we want more than one plane we can create a numpy array of random values that can be plotted. This can be accomplished by modifying the lines\nstrike = r.randint(0,361,5) #5 random strike values (range from min to max-1) dip = r.randint(0,91,5) #5 random dip values  matplotlib is able to unpack and plot the different strike;dip pairs from the two lists.\nA more complex approach is by introducing the concept of plane set. We need a number of planes with the same general orientation and inclination. To do this we can:\n Define a random \u0026ldquo;generator\u0026rdquo; plane. This will define the direction and dip of the set Generate random data based on the generator direction and dip  To give the set a more \u0026ldquo;natural feeling\u0026rdquo; we can use a random number given by a normal distribuition with:\n$$\\mu = \\text{strike} \\text{ or } \\mu = \\text{dip} $$\nand random $\\sigma^2$.\nimport numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import mplstereonet as mpl def random_plane_gen(sets=1, n_planes=10): r_s = np.random.randint(0,361,sets) #random strike r_dip = np.random.randint(0,91,sets) #random dip r_std = np.random.randint(5,20,sets) #random sigma^2 planes_dict = {x:{'s':0,'d':0} for x in range(sets)} ''' We can use dictionaries to be more tidy. For every set there is an entry 0: + s: 0 + d: 0 1: + s: 0 + d: 0 that then can be filled: 0: + s: 120 + d: 20 1: + s: 200 + d: 33 ''' for nset,s,d,std in zip(list(range(sets)),r_s,r_dip,r_std): #take only the absolute values of n_planes random values with center s and given sigma^2 rounded to 2 decimals planes_dict[nset]['s'] = np.abs(np.round(np.random.normal(s,std,n_planes),2)) planes_dict[nset]['d'] = np.abs(np.round(np.random.normal(d,std,n_planes),2)) return planes_dict random_set = random_plane_gen() print(random_set) #print dict def plane_plot(planes_dict,show_planes=1,show_poles=0): #plot with different colors depending on the set (0:red, 1:green, ...) set_color = ['r','g','b','k','m','c'] fig = plt.figure('Stereonet') ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='stereonet') for sets in planes_dict: #for every set present in the dict for i in range(len(planes_dict[sets]['s'])): if show_planes: ax.plane(planes_dict[sets]['s'][i], planes_dict[sets]['d'][i], f'{set_color[sets]}-') if show_poles: ax.pole(planes_dict[sets]['s'][i], planes_dict[sets]['d'][i], f'{set_color[sets]}o') ax.grid() plt.show() plane_plot(random_set)      Example 4 results.

Count the total number of markers detected in all of the uploaded photos. The number of markers needed to be in total always 135. Cut the resulting point clouds with constant dimensions and automatically apply a rotatation to make the plane horizontal. Calculate the difference between two meshes. To make sure that the difference operation was applied properly the two chunks need to be aligned and the models need to be rotated flat and cropped.    Input image example     Reconstructed slope before and after the event \n Summary Mask application The model is constructed using photos that capture a different angle of the artificial plane. The first step is to isolate the relevant slope information by masking the parts of the slope that are not needed for the reconstruction (e.g. the container). To do this different masks were created to mask specific parts present in different sets of photos. The pairing is as follows:\n photo 1 $\\rightarrow$ '' Links_Initial.jpg '' photo 2 to 21 $\\rightarrow$ '' Links_Regular.jpg '' photo 22 $\\rightarrow$ '' Midden_Initial.jpg '' photo 23 to 42 $\\rightarrow$ '' Midden_Regular.jpg '' photo 43 $\\rightarrow$ '' Rechts_Initial.jpg '' photo 44 to 63 $\\rightarrow$ \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;Rechts_Regular.jpg '\u0026rsquo;  This process was accomplished by writing the mask.py script.\nMarker count For each model there is a known fixed number of total markers that need to be detected (135). The objective of this script is to count the total amount of markers detected in the model and print if there are less than 135. This check is done to see if the automatic markers present for each markers are somehow cropped or masked out.\nThe check process was automated using the check_markers.py script\nCut and rotate the model point cloud To apply correctly the difference between the two models they both need to have the same size, position and rotation. To do this it was decided to rotate first the psarse cloud model and then resize the bounding box to a determined size. To do this the following process was defined:\n Define the region size Find the minimum and maximum (for both x and y) points inside the bounding box and calculate the center (as the midpoint of points at opposite corners). Translate the points on the same height of the center point Set these points as tranform reference Update transform (and so rotate the points) Resize the bounding box  To accurately rotate the model the plane needs to fit in the bounding box as tightly as possibile and so the z value need to be low. Too low z values can crop too much of the plane (since the plane has a certain inclination angle) and so the rotation won\u0026rsquo;t be as precise.\nThis process is archived by using the region_size.py script.\nMesh difference Instead of caluclating the difference of the two meshes a quicker is to convert the meshes in Digital Elevation Models and then apply a per pixel difference.\n Final workflow We can summarize the developed metashape workflow as follows:\n   This workflow is resonably fast and has the possibility to batch the processes to further automate the workflow.\n     Reconstructed DEM of the slope before and after the event    DEM difference  ","date":1606262400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606262400,"objectID":"0149d279616f5a85f0322888e78aca88","permalink":"https://gabri.xyz/project/auto-slope/","publishdate":"2020-11-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/auto-slope/","section":"project","summary":"Compute the difference between two referenced slopes reconstructed in Metashape Professional.","tags":["Photogrammetry"],"title":"Automatic processing for referenced slopes","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The premise This idea came to mind while doing university field trips in which we learned how to use a geological compass and how to take measurements (e.g. dip direction/dip) needed for geological interpretation and reconstruction of planes, folds etc..

There are three different types of reconstruction techniques: photogrammetry, 3D scan and CT scan or tomography. These three methods are based on the fundamental concept of obtaining, interpreting, and measuring surface and objects properties without needing a direct contact with the object. This project gives a more in-depth look of photogrammetry, in particular the modern technique defined as Structure from Motion, applied to centimetric macroinvertebrate fossils. Photogrammetry is the most accessible and cost-effective method of the three. The project was entirely developed during the COVID-19 sanitary emergency using already available or easily obtainable equipment. As a second aim and long-term objective, the thesis works as a guide for further experimentation and automation of the process of data capture and processing and to create a digital palaeontological archive that can be used for online accurate analysis of specimens.\nProcedures In photogrammetry the digital reconstruction of an object is given by specialized software that can approximate the position of the photos relative to the object and its structure by capturing photos of different perspectives of the object. Since image capturing can be done with a passive sensor, photogrammetry is the most popular and diffused method of reconstruction. Furthermore, it can produce a textured model, process not always possible in 3D and CT scans. The software used in this project is Agisoft Metashape Professional because it has many tools, and it is efficiently optimized. Two main steps compose the reconstruction process:\n Image capture Computer processing.  The first step consists in a preliminary phase in which lights, camera and the specimen are positioned and the distance between the camera and the specimen is measured. Then, only when the user is certain that the specimen is in a stable fixed position the capturing process starts. The simplest capturing procedure consists in fixing the position of the camera and rotate the specimen on one axis. The angle of rotation needs to be small enough to have an 80% overlap between images. Lighting of the specimen needs to be diffused and multidirectional to avoid sharp shadows. The background needs to be featureless to avoid reconstruction errors.\nThe second step consists in importing the images into the software, process them and construct the final model. The processing in the software is divided in five main phases:\n Image masking Image alignment Formation of a dense cloud Meshing Texturing.  When the model is complete, it can be scaled to the real-world equivalent. In this way the measures taken on the model correspond to the real-world equivalent. For the processes that cannot be done inside the Agisoft Metashape software we proposed python codes precisely written for automatically completing some tasks (e.g. conversion of raw image files in jpg).\nFor the process of image capture, a Nikon D3100 reflex camera was used, in order to better control the focus, ISO and focal ratio parameters and used macro rings, in particular the 12+20mm combination, to capture the most minute details of the specimen. In order to avoid sharp shadows and give a homogeneous lighting to the specimens, we used two table lamps with diffused light. The background was black to increment the contrast with the specimen and help to differentiate the background from the object. To maintain the specimens in a fixed position crocodile-clips were used for a constant and strong grip. Each model was composed by 200 photos and took from 2 to 3 hours to complete. The model reconstruction process was applied to six specimens. Five of them were extracted from recent and Pleistocenic sediments in Solanto (Palermo, Italy), the former belonging to the Sintema di Marsala, precisely to the lithofacies of Calcareniti di Palermo. The sixth one was collected from recent sediments in California (USA). The classification was done by observing the macroscopic characteristics of the specimens and was aided by different texts.\nResults Spondylus gaederopus Linnaeus 1758   Venus verrucosa Linnaeus 1758   Pseudochama gryphina (Lamarck, 1819)   Haliotis tuberculata Linnaeus 1758   Dendraster excentricus (Eschscholtz, 1831)   Conclusions In general, photogrammetric programs have their limitations and cannot reconstruct smooth, reflective, and transparent surfaces. There were in fact some difficulties in reconstructing some characteristics of the studied specimens. The pallial line for example is not present in the models because it is hardly detectable also in the photos. The internal parts for some specimens also were not completely reconstructed because they were smooth and reflective. On the other hand, problems linked to the geometry of a particular specimen were easily resolved by modifying the alignment options. In the end, the results obtained from the application of photogrammetry on these six fossils demonstrate that this is a valid and accessible technique that can give accurate models. I hope in the future that this method of obtaining precise models very quickly can overcome the difficulties encountered and that it can be adopted as a standard to create an always-accessible repository where models can be shared and possibly 3D printed.\n","date":1587600000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587600000,"objectID":"e7f2bd573f9d7a836287f33348dc192b","permalink":"https://gabri.xyz/project/fossils/","publishdate":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fossils/","section":"project","summary":"Methods applied to obtain 3D accurate models of fossils using photogrammetry.","tags":["Paleontology","Photogrammetry"],"title":"3D paleontological objects","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  **Two**  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
